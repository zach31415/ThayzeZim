Find the journeyman

Lucus has prodigious skill and vision, yet he alone cannot manifest the greatest designs.
He requires an anvil upon which to forge ever greater creations.
An anvil also doesn't need to be helping the smith, it simply must be present and mildly controllable.
Lucus seeks to act the catalyst to the genesis of such an anvil.
Currently he wants to test out his version of what's already been established and then intorduce a slight bit of variability.
