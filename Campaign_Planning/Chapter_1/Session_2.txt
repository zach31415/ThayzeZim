Lucus definitely offers to care for the infant Anguis if available, and will give the group an orb of ironwood as reward in addition to the pound of silver with the offer to shape the ironwood should they ever desire it. 
Lucus then warns the group of a series of other powerful beings in this world (shadows and gold and betrayers), beings that seek his annihilation and by extension, may target his agents, such as the party.
Lucus then attempts to dispatch his anvil to a disturbance in the forest to the north to scout and report back as this force appears to be able to unerroringly differentate his children from natural growths.
