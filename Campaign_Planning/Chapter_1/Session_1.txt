===== Session Plans =====

So we really want to make the party stick together, and give them a reason to be a party.  This needs to be pretty unifying, maybe a bit tough, but it should end in absolute and complete success.

The embrace of the Mother is no warm sanctuary, it is cold, distant, and derisive.  The Mother teaches, it does not coddle.  The Mother cultivates, it does not nurture.  The Mother sleeps, yet yearns to wake.

we make tools, bu some times they're required elsewhere
