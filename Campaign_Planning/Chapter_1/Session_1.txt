[[Chapter 1]]

====== Session 1 ======
Session was on: Tuesday 16 November 2021 


===== Session Plans =====

So we really want to make the party stick together, and give them a reason to be a party.  This needs to be pretty unifying, maybe a bit tough, but it should end in absolute and complete success.

The embrace of the Mother is no warm sanctuary, it is cold, distant, and derisive.  The Mother teaches, it does not coddle.  The Mother cultivates, it does not nurture.  The Mother sleeps, yet yearns to wake.

Peace offering: A Primitve, amophous, unmade Ironwood
we make tools, but some times they're required elsewhere

Welcome to this Sanctuary, I imagine you all will have questions.
