== Cave Entrance: ==
Natural cave formation with a small stream running into a shallow basin pool, a watered steel archway embedded into the wall.  The mantle is inscribed in kobold runes, reading: "To you seekers of what we saw, sanctuary and salvation."

== Antechamber: ==
A 10 by 20 chamber.  The walls are first formed of a fine diagonal hashing of watered steel bands which appears to be floating a couple inches from a perfectly smooth, unadorned, solid watered steel shell.  The far wall features a 5 1/2 ft. tall arch which breaches the hashing and edges a closed rectangular doorway. 
Archway Inscription: "Enter only who are among the Travelers.  Attain the means to quench the Lightless Embers."

== Boiling Path: ==
Approximately 250 ft. long, starts out at 4 1/2 ft. by 5 1/2 ft. and narrows down to arround 2 by 4 ft. though the last three feet or so is comprised of a crawl only a foot and a half high.

== Cella: ==
 eliptic trapezoid (egg shaped) widened at the entrance and narrowing going forward.  The ceiling is about 50 ft. above the entrance point, and the group rises in two tiers to a brilliant statue of a flame wreathed kobold, roughly sixty (60) ft. from the entrance way.  The statue holds in an outstretched hand the Life Ward, a shape appearing to be two intersecting cubes such that the corners of one perfectly cut through the face of the other, with the form created by hatching watered steel bands with the internal negative filled with a swirling form of magma.  Every level up cuts movement speen in half by an incredible weighting on the limbs.  Once the Life Ward is removed from the outsretched hand of the kobold statue, the area will collapse.
