====== Goblinkin ======

A collection of like subspecies with relativley fast lives, the goblinkin are united in both heritage and a love for excitement and revelry, and there's few things as exciting or worthy of revelery as fighting.

===== Physicality =====
In truth a collection of three subspecies (gremlins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), the goblinkin collectively have rough, green flesh and long, poited ears.  The gremlins are the smallest of the golinkin (litterally "small" creatures), and generally have a clever, if malicious, mischievous nature about them, and tend to be rather ingenous in their traps and machinations.  The hobgoblins are generally the leaders of goblinkin warbands, with long limbs, flat faces, and minds suited for the long strategy.  The bugbears are massive (just barely "medium" with "powerful build") and often are where the enemy line breaks, perhaps not the most clever creatures, they certainly know how to swing a macana, and hard.  The goblinkin infants mature relatively rapidly, reaching adolescence at seven and maturity at thirteen.  The average maximum lifespan of all three subspecies is around sixty.
