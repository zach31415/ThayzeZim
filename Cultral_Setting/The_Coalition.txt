====== The Coalition ======

The empire of the elven peoples.  Comprised of four city states; Elesmira, Liapeng, Sheinor, and Falsyn, The Coalition rules with an iron fist.  Stories of vicious goblinkin, naive humans, subversive kobolds, militant dwarves, and purely evil sauri lay the foundation of society.  Xenophobia rationalizes and justifies exoranant taxation, strict travel regulations, and firm policing.  The Coalition is a highly authoritarian confederacy.  A council of four political elites preside over each city state with the four councils combining to form the Council Mai in times of peril or for great decisions.  The councils themselves govern by means of an aristocracy of great houses.  Through a delicate web of economic and political leverage, most of the councilors are in fact puppets to benefactors and blackmailers.  To have power over the Coalition often means giving up power over yourself.  The population of the Coalition is approximately ninety-percent elven with a rough eight-percent comprising humans and a remaining two percent of predominantly dwarves and kobolds.


==== Elesmira ====
	Elesmira is a city from another age.  Overlooking the basin itself, the city is comprised of a thousand thin spires reaching towards the heavens, each one gleaming white with golden accent.  The Gleaming City of the Fair Folk, Elesmira’s origins are lost even to the elven records, but it remains a testament to the power of the Coalition.  Holding great repositories of knowledge concerning all from the arcane to the historic, Elesmira has cultivated a culture of the sage, the scribe, the learned.  Magic blossoms everywhere and institutions of the arcane are standard.
	

==== Liapeng ====
	The Pearl City of Liapeng is the economic powerhouse of the Coalition.  Dominated by elite guilds, the majority of fine arts, metallurgy, and carpentry found within the Coalition originated in Liapeng.  The southernmost of the cities, Liapeng had historically dealt with Sauri raids and assaults, but those have ceased for recent memory.  Under the respite, farms and smaller settlements have extended beyond the city proper and encroach upon Rara’Jin itself.
	

==== Sheinor ====
	Sheinor
	

==== Falsyn ====
	Falsyn, the northernmost city of the Coalition as well as the smallest and newest.  Originally a fortification against goblin aggression, the city has since flourished into a metropolis, due primarily to the dual factors of favorable trade with the human’s Golden Union and its stabler climate.  A strong military presence persists in the city, and a profitable export of grains and textiles fuels continued growth.














=== History ===
So, in that region, basically everything is elven, and has been for as long as any memory serves.  Most all of these ruins are the ancestral homes of elves before the goblinkin wars.  They used to live in these small communities made from piles hollowed out boulders, but these were all vacated over the years in favor of more defensible and compact cities.  Most of the small ones are lost under layers of moss and vegetation, but the larger collections (generally 5-6 boulders) can still be found in remote places.
