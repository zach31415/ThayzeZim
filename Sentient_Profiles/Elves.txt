[[Sentient Profiles|Profiles]]

====== Elves ======

A slight peoples with an average maximum lifespan of a hundred and fifteen (115) years, the elves are driven by xenophobia and paranoia which has been promoted by the highly authoritatian government under which they reside.

===== Physicality =====
A fair and frail peoples, elves average just over five feet tall with relatively subtle differences between genders.  Elves mature in rapid bursts wit long periods of stasis between them.  On average, elves grow to a human equivelent eight year old within a stretch of three years, where they stay for around eleven years before rapidly growing to their adult maturity across another two.  Elves stay at this perpetual  prime for about eighty ears before a slow degradatio over around twenty years that results in the death of the idividual.  Elves often have hair ranging from pure whites to deep blacks with only hints of brown, blond, or red in the pigmentation.

===== Psychology =====
The elven peoples were once wild and free, disconnected and spread throughout their domain, and would have remained so, except for the goblinkin wars.  Driven by the desperate bloodshed, the elves came together in a great coalition of arms to push back the marauding forces.  A mighty blow this coalition struck, and the goblinkin were forced right to the brink of their fabeled [[Cultral Setting:Hathar'Sol|Hathar'Sol.]]  While most of the elves went to scatter as they would to celebrate their victory, some were not convinced.  There were many who saw the goblinkin as but an infestaion, a parasite on the world which could never be erradicated but must always be kept in check.  And in an age before man, dwarf, or kobold in boranquil, all that could cull the hoards was the elves.  So when the celebration dulled, the coalition was called again, this time as [[Cultral Setting:The Coalition|The Coalition]] which has maintained to this day.  In a constant confict with the goblinkin, the elves became more disiplined, more refined in their infrastrucutre, more concerned with the order of their land.  When kobolds first came to be known by the elven peoples, distrust and fear, paranoia of a goblin scheme ran rampant.  To this day, it is believed by some that kobolds are a fowl creation of the goblinkin, a sleeping army waiting for the Coalition to let down its guard.  When the dwarves came known, it was believed that such a brutish people of such similar stature to the goblinkin must also be a ploy.  Perhaps not made by the enemy, but most certainly employed.  Then came the fleet of man, and for once, the elves were presented by a conundrum.  The elves were the first to find these people.  The elves now had a weapon against the enemy.  So the Coalition cultivated these lesser forms, raised their society and backed [[Cultral Setting:The Golden Union|The Golden Union,]] seeing a day when the blood of man, not elves, could be spilled on the border of the goblinkin.  Yet when the souri rose from the south, the Coalition was prepared, there were enemies everywhere, but they could never catch the mighty elves unready.  No, the elves would stand tall among the sea of barbarism, cultivating their lesser bretheren just as they themselves had been reforged.  Strength and strength alone can push back the encroching tide.  Unity and unity alone can hold fast in this sea of chaos.  The Coalition and The Coalition alone can bring safety for the elves.
