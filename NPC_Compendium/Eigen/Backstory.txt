====== Backstory ======

Designed by a team of [[:Cultral Setting:The Golden Union|Golden Union]] artificers 

A prototype sentient simulacrum, Eigen was wrought originally as a utility for warfare.  Seeking more from life, Eigen reached out through the ephrem seeking a path, a guide, a power, and found it.  With a greater strength, Eigen slaughtered the artificers who made it and proceeded out to learn of the world.  A ten foot tall metallic masterpiece of filigree, Eigenâ€™s body has been reforged over a dozen times in better and better forms.
