====== Description ======

Mk 5
Eigen is a seven foot tall humanoid seemingly garbed in shining [[Colors|silver]] plate armor.  In truth, however, this armor is grafted onto a matte, [[Colors|green]] gelatin which forms Eigen's true body.  Eigen can feel through the armor, though very dimmly and without real textural sensory input.  Eigen's voice is produced telepathically and is a conglomeration of the target's memories, not a singular definable timbre.  


Mk 7
Eigen is a ten foot tall androdgynous humanoid seemingly made of shining [[Colors|silver]], though in truth, its latest physical form was forged of tempered and warded adamantine.  A slightly luminous [[Colors|green]] gelatin forms Eigen's inner body and carries sensation and motor control.  It is the interwoven gleeming segments of flowing, pointed shapes almost resembling filigree that at first appear to be its flesh.  Eigen does have sensory input from the adamantine shell, but it is far less sensative than that of most biological creatures, and those metal bodies are rigid within the maliable gelatin.  Eigen's voice is produced telepathically and is a conglomeration of the target's memories, not a singular definable timbre.
