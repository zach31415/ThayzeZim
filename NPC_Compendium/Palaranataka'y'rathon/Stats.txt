The specter can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain.  It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

//**Draining Eldritch Surge**//
As a bonus action, the next sucessful weapon attack deals an additional 2d8 necrotic damage and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to this necrotic damage taken.  This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest.  The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
