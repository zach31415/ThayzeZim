====== Description ======

A balding fellow with a half empty maw of warped, yellow teeth, Lucus is very... //earthy//.  Stringy hair hangs over dusty brows which shelter sharp green eyes.  Grubby hands, grubby clothes, and and a grubby voice, there isn't a clean line in his being.  A wabling walk and a thoaty cackle make for a fool, right up until cracked nails dig into flesh.  A easy, laughing man, when angered however, Lucus can only be described as feral.  They say fear not the man who has practiced a thousand strikes once, but rather the man who has practiced one strike a thousand times.  Once meeting Lucus you'll see that fear should rather be reserved for the man who lauches themself as a beast raving vengence.  Magic suffuses Lucus, and while genius, a dark madness torments him.  Fear the man yes, but also pitty him.  For behind those viper eyes reside knowledge of a possibility, of a dream and vision of a glorious could-be that cannot be wrought into this primative world.  One day though, one day he'll see it again, one day he'll live that ephemeral glimpse.  One day drawing near.
